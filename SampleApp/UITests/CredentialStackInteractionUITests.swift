import XCTest

/// Drives `CredentialStack` with real touch input on-device via
/// `XCUIApplication` - taps, long-presses and drags, not a simulated
/// callback invocation - because the whole point of this component is that
/// tap, long-press and drag resolve correctly against each other, and that
/// is exactly the kind of thing a plain unit test calling a gesture
/// callback directly cannot catch. Port of the Kotlin sample app's
/// `CredentialStackInteractionTest`
/// (`sample-app/src/androidTest/kotlin/org/siros/sdk/sample/
/// CredentialStackInteractionTest.kt`).
///
/// Two real bugs an on-device test like this one is what actually caught in
/// both implementations, neither visible from reading the gesture code in
/// isolation:
///
/// - Two independent gesture recognizers reaching for the same touch
///   silently starve one another (the Kotlin sample app's first attempt,
///   and this port's own first attempt at composing a per-card
///   `.gesture()` with `CredentialCardView`'s own tap handling, both hit
///   this). SwiftUI's version of the trap turned out to run one layer
///   deeper still: even with exactly ONE `.gesture()` per card and none on
///   `CredentialCardView` itself, SwiftUI did not arbitrate those
///   independent per-card recognizers across `ZStack` siblings by touch
///   point - only the single sibling considered topmost by `zIndex` ever
///   received a touch, anywhere in the deck, confirmed via raw
///   (non-element-relative) coordinate taps that bypassed XCUITest's own
///   convenience APIs entirely. `CredentialStack` resolves this with
///   exactly ONE recognizer for the WHOLE deck, doing its own hit-testing
///   arithmetic (`hitTestCard`) instead of relying on SwiftUI to arbitrate
///   several.
/// - A long-press timeout checked only when a touch-move event happens to
///   arrive never fires for a finger held perfectly still, since
///   `DragGesture.onChanged` delivers no further events between touch-down
///   and release when nothing moves.
///
/// Launches the real app with `SIROS_SAMPLE_APP_FIXTURE_CREDENTIALS=1`,
/// which seeds a plain 3-credential fixture set and skips straight past
/// login (see `WalletViewModel.fixtureCredentials`) - this exercises the
/// exact same `CredentialsView`/`CredentialStack` the user sees, wired up
/// exactly as production does, with no backend/wallet session/key material
/// needed, same as the Kotlin test renders `CredentialStack` directly over a
/// fixture list.

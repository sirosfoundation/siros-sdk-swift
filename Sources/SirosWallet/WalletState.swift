    /// does, and `cachedAccounts` no longer lists it.

    /// The one qualification: the SDK only forgets an account it has
    /// identified. A login refused before its passkey resolved to a cached
    /// account - the ceremony never completed, or it completed with a
    /// credential this deployment does not know - leaves every cached account
    /// alone, because the alternative is deleting one the refusal was not
    /// about. So treat `.deactivated` as "this account is gone if it is
    /// listed", not as "`cachedAccounts` is now empty"; render whatever it
    /// actually contains.
    ///

    /// (go-wallet-backend#340), never by `message` - which is prose for the
    /// user. A backend older than #340 sends no `scope`, and `WALLET_REVOKED`
    /// then resolves to the per-instance `.revoked`, so nothing local is lost
    /// on a backend that cannot say which it meant.
    ///
    /// What an app should offer: for `.suspended`, a retry - a later `login()`
